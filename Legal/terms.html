    </div>
  </header>

    <p class="lead">
      These Terms of Use govern your access to and use of <strong>PathCA</strong>. By visiting, browsing, or using this website in any manner, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must immediately stop using the platform. Continued use of PathCA constitutes your acceptance of these Terms in full.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose of the Platform</h2>

    <p>
      PathCA is an educational practice platform created to help students test their preparation through multiple-choice questions, performance tracking, and analytical insights. The platform is designed strictly for learning, self-evaluation, and practice purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      PathCA does not claim to be an official examination body, coaching institute, or academic authority. The platform is intended to supplement a student's preparation and should not be treated as a replacement for official study materials, textbooks, or professional guidance.
    </p>

    <h2>Content Sources and Ownership</h2>

    <p>
      The questions, concepts, and practice material available on PathCA are compiled from a variety of publicly accessible and educational sources, including but not limited to previous examinations, textbooks, reference materials, online educational platforms, and community-shared resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      PathCA does not claim original ownership of third-party questions or content. Any resemblance to content found elsewhere is incidental and arises due to the educational and commonly shared nature of examination material.
    </p>

    <p>
      Content may be reformatted, reorganized, or adapted to suit the structure of practice tests and analytics, without altering the fundamental educational intent of the material.
    </p>

    <h2>Accuracy and Educational Limitation</h2>

    <p>
      While reasonable care is taken to present accurate questions and answers, PathCA does not guarantee the absolute correctness, completeness, or reliability of any content provided on the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Users are strongly advised to cross-verify answers with official syllabi, textbooks, and authoritative sources. Practice results, scores, and insights generated on PathCA are indicative only and should not be considered final, certified, or authoritative.
    </p>

    <p>
      PathCA shall not be responsible for any academic decisions, examination outcomes, or consequences arising from reliance on platform content.
    </p>

    <h2>User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use</h2>

    <p>
      By using PathCA, you agree to use the platform in a lawful, ethical, and responsible manner. Any attempt to misuse, disrupt, reverse-engineer, scrape, or exploit the platform or its data is strictly prohibited.
    </p>

    <p>
      Users must not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the platform, interfere with its functionality, or use it for misleading, harmful, or unlawful purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      PathCA reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate access to users found violating these Terms, without prior notice.
    </p>

    <h2>No Affiliation or Endorsement</h2>

    <p>
      PathCA is an independent educational platform and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to any examination authority, educational board, institution, or regulatory body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any names, exams, or references used on the platform are solely for descriptive and educational purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Accounts and User Data</h2>

    <p>
      Certain features of PathCA may require user authentication to enable progress tracking and analytics. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials.
    </p>

    <p>
      All activity performed under a user's account shall be deemed to have been carried out by that user. PathCA shall not be responsible for unauthorized access caused by user negligence.
    </p>

    <h2>Availability and Modifications</h2>

    <p>
      PathCA is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. The platform may experience temporary interruptions due to maintenance, updates, technical issues, or external factors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Features, content, or functionality may be modified, enhanced, or removed at any time without prior notice, in order to improve the platform or comply with operational requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

    <div class="highlight-box warning">
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, PathCA shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the platform.</p>
    </div>

      This includes, but is not limited to, academic losses, examination results, data loss, or reliance on platform content.
    </p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

    </p>

    <p>
      Unauthorized reproduction, redistribution, or imitation of the platform's design or technical structure is strictly prohibited.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>

    <p>
      PathCA reserves the right to update or revise these Terms of Use at any time. Changes will become effective immediately upon being published on this page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Continued use of the platform after such changes indicates acceptance of the revised Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>Governing Understanding</h2>

    <p>
      These Terms are intended to operate in good faith, balancing user interests with the responsible operation of the platform. If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain valid and effective.
