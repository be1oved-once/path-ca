      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">How we protect your data and respect your privacy</p>
    </div>
  </header>

    <p class="lead">
      At <strong>PathCA</strong>, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any information you share while using our platform. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and how we safeguard it.
    </p>

    <p>
      By accessing or using PathCA, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, you should discontinue using the website.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>
      PathCA collects only the minimum information required to provide a smooth and meaningful learning experience. This may include basic account details such as an email address or username if you choose to sign in, along with practice-related data such as attempts, scores, accuracy, streaks, and general usage statistics.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may also collect limited technical information such as device type, browser information, and page visit counts to help monitor performance and improve platform stability. PathCA does <strong>not</strong> collect sensitive personal information such as phone numbers, physical addresses, financial data, or government-issued identifiers.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>
      The information collected on PathCA is used strictly for educational, analytical, and operational purposes. This includes tracking learning progress, generating performance insights, improving accuracy and efficiency, and enhancing the overall user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data may also be used to maintain basic security, detect misuse, and ensure the platform functions reliably. PathCA does <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, lease, or trade user information to third parties under any circumstances.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies and Local Storage</h2>

    <p>
      PathCA may use cookies or browser-based local storage technologies to manage sessions, maintain login states, remember user preferences such as theme selection, and store limited activity data for convenience.
    </p>

    <p>
      These technologies do not collect personally identifiable information beyond what is required for core functionality and user experience. You may choose to disable cookies through your browser settings, though some features may not function as intended.
    </p>

    <h2>Practice Content and User Activity</h2>

    <p>
      All practice attempts, answers, and performance data are stored solely to help users analyze their preparation and improve academically. Your answers are not publicly shared with other users.
    </p>

    <p>
      If leaderboards or comparison features are present, they display limited information strictly for academic reference. Wherever possible, data is processed in an aggregated or anonymized form.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>
      PathCA may rely on third-party services for infrastructure, hosting, authentication, or analytics. These services are used solely to operate, secure, and maintain the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such third-party providers are governed by their own privacy policies. PathCA does not control how external services handle data beyond their intended operational purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising and Promotions</h2>

    <p>
      As of now, PathCA does <strong>not</strong> display advertisements, sponsored content, tracking pixels, or promotional material.
    </p>

    <p>
      If advertising or monetization features are introduced in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated clearly to reflect such changes.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <p>
      We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect user data from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. These measures include secure authentication mechanisms, restricted data access, and ongoing monitoring.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, no online platform can guarantee absolute security. Users are responsible for safeguarding their login credentials and accessing the platform responsibly.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      PathCA is intended for students preparing for academic examinations. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children below the applicable legal age without appropriate consent.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you believe that a minor has unintentionally provided personal information, please contact us so corrective action can be taken.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect legal, technical, or operational changes. Any updates will be published on this page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Continued use of PathCA after updates are made constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>

    <p>
